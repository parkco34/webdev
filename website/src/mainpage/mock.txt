- 2 Components: Carousel and CarouselItem
- Carousel is the main controller for controlling the images
- CarouselItem component renders the item itself, but we pass the width
  property to it for the moment.
- Controlling the active item is done using "transform: translateX" for the
  div.inner.
- Iterate all the children and adjust the width property.
    ~ fixing the width to 100% means only one item will be visible.

React.Children.map = Invokes function on immediate child contained within
    Children /w 'this' set to 'thisArg'.
React.cloneElement(element, [props], [...children]) = Clones and returns a bew
    React element as a starting point.
